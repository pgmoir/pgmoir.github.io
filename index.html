<h1>Moir Consultancy Limited - Philip Moir (pgmoir)</h1>
<p>Experienced, knowledgable, passionate and dedicated full stack developer, with extensive Microsoft .Net and Javascript knowledge. Good at problem solving, having had solid experience of supporting applications for 30 years. A solid communicator, easily working in a team environment, excellent at motivating teams and building enthusiasm for application development.</p>
<p>Technically knowledgeable, drawing from many years in the field, and working in structured and agile analysis and development methods. I like to promote Agile, TDD, BDD, pairing, code-reviewing, mentoring and continuous delivery. My experiences have also led me to understand how teams work and deliver, and how they collectively can better achieve company and group goals. In addition to development skills, I am ably-handed as a Business Analyst, and also now certified as a Scrum Master.</p>
<p>Presented and demonstrated software at tech and product conferences, and openly connected with online users to better harvest opinion, support and use of products.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm that extends beyond the work place, constantly learning new methods and technologies, and now extending that passion on to my children in the form of building gaming PCs, writing Unity/C# driven gaming projects, personal web presence, and sports clubs websites.</p>
<p>Beyond the world of tech, other passions including road cycling (currently training for Etape du Tour 2017), skiing and miniatures painting.</p>
<p>Currently looking for challenging contracts where the focus is on delivering features to an end product and user. Where quality is held in high regard, but a pragmatic approach is equally valuable. Happy working with both new and old code bases, supporting applications, but delivering improvements and enhancements, or green-field environments where everything is being considered. Keen to work in a team environment where they can contribute to its evolvement and are proud of what they build and deliver.</p>
